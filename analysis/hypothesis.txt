The extra degree of error rate is correct. 

Evidence: Assume all spectral weights are 1. Increasing K 
(max modes in each direction) 
to the finest grid size causes the rate to drop to the expected
-s instead of -s-1. As K decreases, it drops to -s-1. 

Need models with various K
Then get slope versus K for each s
